Network Intrusion Detection System

Develop a network-based intrusion detection system using tools like Snort or Suricata. Set up rules and alerts to identify and respond to suspicious network activity You can even visualize the detected attacks.
### What is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)?
A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security solution that monitors and analyzes network traffic for suspicious activities or policy violations. It works by inspecting the packets that flow through a network to detect unauthorized access, malware, or other harmful activities. NIDS primarily focuses on identifying threats like intrusions, attacks, and anomalies, helping organizations detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time.

NIDS can detect known attack patterns based on predefined signatures (signature-based detection) or identify unusual behaviors and deviations from normal traffic patterns (anomaly-based detection). When a threat is detected, the system generates an alert, allowing security teams to investigate and take corrective action.

### What is Snort?
Snort is a free, open-source Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that is widely used to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats in real-time. It works by capturing network packets and analyzing them based on a set of predefined rules to identify malicious activities, such as port scans, buffer overflows, and attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.

Snort can operate in three modes:
1. *Sniffer Mode*: Snort captures and displays the network traffic in real-time.
2. *Packet Logger Mode*: Snort logs network packets for later analysis.
3. *Network Intrusion Detection Mode*: Snort uses a set of rules to detect malicious traffic and generate alerts.

Snort's flexibility and robust rule-based system make it an essential tool for detecting and preventing cyber threats in both small and large networks.

### What is Npcap?
Npcap is a packet-capturing library for Windows that allows applications, such as Snort, to capture and send raw network traffic. It is an essential component for network analysis and security tools that need to capture network packets to function properly.

Npcap provides high-performance packet sniffing capabilities and is compatible with the WinPcap API, which many network monitoring tools use. It supports capturing packets from Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and loopback devices, enabling Snort to monitor and analyze network traffic in real-time. During the installation of Npcap, you can choose options like "WinPcap API-compatible mode" to ensure compatibility with older software like Snort. 

In summary, Npcap acts as a bridge between network traffic and tools like Snort, enabling them to capture and analyze data from the network effectively.

I would like to sincerely thank CodeAlpha for this wonderful opportunity to work on such a hands-on project in Cyber Security. Learning to build a Network Intrusion Detection System using Snort has been an incredible experience that has enhanced both my technical skills and my understanding of network security. I am truly grateful to CodeAlpha for the chance to apply my knowledge in a practical setting and grow as a cybersecurity professional.
